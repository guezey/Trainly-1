# Trainly

**Trainly**, an Android app to organize train travels, was my CS102 term project, on which my three teammates and I spent four months.

We designed and implemented the whole project by ourselves from ground to end. 
The project's main aim was to let us demonstrate the outcomes of our 1<sup>st</sup>-year Computer Science classes CS101-2 [^1] at Bilkent University.
However, we ended up learning and using way more than what we had learned in uni.

Trainly was able to convince our professors that we had learned enough to create a whole project from start to end.

This archive includes our process reports as well as implementation (in Java) and design (in XML) files, but not the entire project. We'd used Git and GitHub throughout the project; however, it now lies in a far away private repo. So, I didn't want to include all the mess and uploaded only the essential pieces. Hopefully, it gives enough idea about our work.

We mainly used **Android Studio** for coding and designing, and **Google Cloud** and **SQL** for database related parts.

You can always reach out to me for any further details :)
